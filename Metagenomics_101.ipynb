    "            - you supply the GFF file, which contains the positions of the genes (or open reading frames), and the .bam file, which contains for all the reads the positions where they map. Feature counts just counts how many reads map on each of the open reading frames.\n",
    "            - output in mg.CDS_counts.tsv contains a line with the cull call to featureCounts and a header line and then one line for all features in the GFF file.

    "        - Running featureCounts for KO profiles \n",
    "            - featureCounts can also get numbers of reads per level of the same annotations, e.g. KOs. To run the calculation for the open reading frames that were annotated with a KO, we first need to filter the GFF file, because featureCounts is a bit unflexible with its input:\n",

    "            - When working with functional profiles, sometimes you will be interested in how many copies you had of a gene and how abundant they are. For example, you may have identified a function of interest. With your GFF file, it is quite easy to identify the genes that have this function (see session 07). Now, you could look at the number of reads that map to each of those genes in the featureCounts output from the start of this lesson. But this only tells you how many reads overlapped. If the genes have different lengths, this is not the best measure of their abundance. In this case, you would want to have the average coverage:\n",
